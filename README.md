## Description
Manually creating a logo can be a tedious process. This is a tool designed to make generating SVG logos quick and simple. There are three options for shapes for your logo: squares, triangles, and circles. The colors and the text are decided by the user. The generated SVG file will be added into the output section of the repository for your use.

## Usage
 Start the program with the command node index.js. Answer all the prompts. For text and background color, you can enter either a color keyword like red, blue, or yellow, or you can enter a hexadecimal color value. For text on the logo, you can enter up to 3 characters.

A video showcasing the process of generating the logo and the successful tests can be viewed at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DduoSFnafnFI0VvftUZVQlffGECv6Yy-/view.
