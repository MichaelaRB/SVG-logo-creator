## Description
 This is a tool designed to make generating SVG logos quick and simple. There are three options for shapes for your logo: squares, triangles, and circles. The colors and the text are decided by the user. The generated SVG file will be added into the output section of the repository for your use.

## Usage
 Start the program with the command node index.js. Answer all the prompts. For text and background color, you can enter either a color keyword, ie red, blue, yellow, etc., or you can enter a hexadecimal color value. For text on the logo, you can enter up to 3 characters.

## Installation
 This project is dependent on Inquirer and Jest. Run npm install in the terminal before use to install the necessary modules.

## Tests
